## 🎯 What Is Dead Rails?

**Dead Rails** is a popular horror-themed Roblox game where players must survive waves of zombies while collecting bonds scattered across a train environment. The goal is to collect as many bonds as possible before the timer runs out or you get killed. Players can also attempt challenges such as "Auto Win", "Auto Finish", and "Bring All Items".

With our arsenal scripts, you can automate repetitive tasks, gain unfair advantages, and even complete the game with one click!
